# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms



Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of data structures and algorithms implementations I've developed while following the "Data Structures and Algorithms using C and C++" course by Abdul Bari. 



The repository is organized by topics, each containing files with related functions and algorithms. These implementations are sourced from lectures, exercises, and student challenges in the course. Topics cover arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, searching, and more.



Feel free to make pull requests for improvements or additional implementations!



Thanks to Abdul Bari and the "Data Structures and Algorithms using C and C++" course for inspiring this repository.
